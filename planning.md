Steps:
1.  **Figure out what decisions you're enabling.**
    - **Choose your domain** -- This might be as general as public transit, bike share, real estate development, national parks, etc. Chances are that, as you're thinking about a domain, you're also thinking about the next point...
    - **Choose your users** -- Who do you want to empower with information to make decisions in your domain. For example, if you chose public transit, then are you interested in empowering riders? Dispatchers? If you chose national parks, are you interested in visitors? 
    - **Decide what your users could do with better information** -- Make a list of the particular decisions you want to enable with your dashboard. This can be a blue-sky list, but you will likely end up refining your scope later.
2.  **Figure out what data you need to enable the decisions.**

You dashboard should be somewhere on the operational spectrum ()

Your dashboard should include some interactivity. That could be:
- Filtering -- Showing the same visualizations for a dynamically chosen subset of available data
- Cross-filtering -- 
- Drilling down -- 

Skills that you'll need for this project:
- Requesting data using `fetch`
- Responding to interaction events
- Building maps and charts
